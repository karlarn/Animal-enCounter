# Animal EnCounter

Animal EnCounter is for the young and young at heart. This app gives you the ability to 
log all the animals you have seen in a day. For every animal you log 
you collect XP. Your XP accumulates and lets you compete with other Encounter users 
on a leaderboard for the number one spot. You have the ability to check other user's profiles 
and save them as friends for quicker access.
